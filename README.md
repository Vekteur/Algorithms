# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures.
All algorithms are written in modern c++ and aim to be simple and efficient.
Several implementations have been adapted from the great resource http://e-maxx.ru/.
Tests have been written for each algorithm but they are not extensive.
The test library is [catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
